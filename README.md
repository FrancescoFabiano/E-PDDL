# E-PDDL

E-PDDL is an extension of the well know PDDL for epistemic planning.
The repository contains the initial version of a parser that converts E-PDDL doamains in mAp (Fabiano et al. 2019), the input language of EFP 2.0 (Fabiano et al. 2020), an epistemic planner.

As future steps we plan to add a conversion also for PDKB-PDDL, the input language for another epistemic planner: PDKB (Muise et al. 2015).
